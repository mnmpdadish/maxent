# To compile:

check makefile first (armadillo include header directory ad linking)
have armadillo installed
have lapack and blas (or mkl) installed
have gnuplot installed (available from command line).

Then type:

```shell
$ make
```

# To run:

```shell
$ cd testMaxEnt
$ ../maxEnt fictiveGreenI.dat
```

then check A.dat with gnuplot. Kind of basic for now.
